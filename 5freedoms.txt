5 FREEDOMS

The 5 Freedoms is an animal welfare concept which the UK government created. These concept is still widely being implied up to this day to provide animal’s primary welfare needs.

1. Freedom from Hunger and Thirst - For animals to be have a good and have the capacity to deal with their daily lives, one should have adequate food and water.
2. Freedom from Discomfort -  Animals also need shelters or space where they can lay just like humans.
3. Freedom from Pain, Injury or Disease – By prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment. When animals are in pain, we need to atleast check up on them or visit a "vet" to know how to treat them.
4. Freedom to Express Normal Behaviour - Since animals behave in their own way, every animal should have their own space where they can be with their own kind
5. Freedom from Fear and Distress – Animals, just like human beings are living creatures that doesn’t deserve to be tortured nor to be treated unpleasantly.
