Animals in entertainment

One thing that animals are widely used for, aside from food, is entertainment. Zoos are common places where animals are used for human entertainment. They are a popular place to go to escpecially when these zoos offer people to see wild or exotic animals. Some of these animals though are kept in small spaces, sometimes not all their needs are given to them and they are also deprived of their natural habitat.

To name a few more of animal uses for human entertainment there is hunting, canned hunting, dancing bears, bullfighting, dog fighting and racing. Some of the animals involved in these are punished in order for them to be tamed. Some end up injured, even worse, dead. They are robbed of their freedom to express their natural behaviours.
