                    <p>Animal welfare primarily focuses on the well-being of animals and our symbiotic relationshiop with them It follow the notion that animals, even though non-human, should be treated with the proper respect and should be free from unnecessary suffering and cruelty. As humans, we are responsible for taking care of them and giving them a suitable environment to live and reproduce in whilst also positively nurturing their growth. If we take care of them properly, they in turn will take care of us. We as humans depend on the coexistence of different species in order to have a stable functioning ecology. Similarly, we need to establish a certain kinship with animals in order to . They play a major role in the “sustenance” of our daily lives.<br /> <span id="emphasis">Such is the conviction behind Animal Welfare.</span></p>

                <div class="articlebody">
                    <p><span>People often mistake Animal welfare and animal rights to be the same thing, but both are actually very different. Animal rights says that the animals must not be used for our necessity like food, entertainment, clothing and even for experimentation. While Animal welfare allows the use of animals as long as the animals are treated in the right way.</span>
                    <span>The goal of animal rights is to stop animal exploitation done by humans. While the goal of animal welfare is to minimize, if not put to an end, any suffering and cruelty towards animals. Animal welfare is focused on making sure that the animals are cared for and are in good condition. Animal welfare makes sure that proper guidelines are followed when the animals are used for food consumption, performing, creating clothes and more. These guidelines are implemented to ensure that the animals are in good and proper condition.</span></p>
