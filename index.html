	<h2>What is animal welfare</h2>
	<p>Animal welfare primarily focuses on the well-being of animals and our symbiotic relationship with them
    It follow the notion that animals, even though non-human, should be treated with the proper respect and should
    be free from unnecessary suffering and cruelty. As humans, we are responsible for taking care of them and giving them
    a suitable environment to live and reproduce in whilst also positively nurturing their growth. If we take care of them
    properly, they in turn will take care of us. Such is the conviction behind Animal Welfare.
    </p>
	<br />

	<h2>The importance of animal welfare</h2>
	<p>Animal welfare's importance stems from the very nature of humanity. Self interest dictates
that we do certain actions/activites that assure us of our "future" (e.g. Taking care of
animals for food and as a means of livelihood) Whatever the reason, one cannot deny that animals
play an important role in today's society.  
</p>

	<br />
	<h2>The five freedoms</h2>
	<p>The five freedoms state aspects of animal welfare that are under human control.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Freedom from hunger or thirst by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour.</li>
		<li>Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area</li>
		<li>Freedom from pain, injury or disease by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment</li>
		<li>Freedom to express (most) normal behaviour by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal's own kind</li>
		<li>Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering</li>
	</ol>

	<br />

	<h2>Why should people care?</h2>
	<p>	
	We as humans depend on the coexistence of different species in order to have a stable functioning ecology. Similarly, we need to establish a certain kinship with animals in order to support our daily lives. They play a major role in the “sustenance” of our daily lives. They’re an important source of food as well as playing a major part in other activities such as scientific research, recreation, and the production of clothing among others. In that sense, the proper care and respect should be given to them.
