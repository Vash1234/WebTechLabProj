	<h2>What is animal welfare</h2>
	<p>Animal welfare primarily focuses on the well-being of animals and our symbiotic relationshiop with them
    It follow the notion that animals, even though non-human, should be treated with the proper respect and should
    be free from unnecessary suffering and cruelty. As humans, we are responsible for taking care of them and giving them
    a suitable environment to live and reproduce in whilst also positively nurturing their growth. If we take care of them
    properly, they in turn will take care of us. Such is the conviction behind Animal Welfare.

	<h2>Why should people care?</h2>
	<p>	
	We as humans depend on the coexistence of different species in order to have a stable functioning ecology. Similarly, we need to establish a certain kinship with animals in order to . They play a major role in the “sustenance” of our daily lives. They’re an important source of food as well as playing a major part in other activities such as scientific research, recreation, and the production of clothing among others. In that sense, the proper care and respect should be given to them.
