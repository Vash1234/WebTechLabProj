Animal welfare vs. Animal Rights

People often mistake Animal welfare and animal rights to be the same thing, but both are actually very different. Animal rights says that the animals must not be used for our necessity like food, entertainment, clothing and even for experimentation. While Animal welfare allows the use of animals as long as the animals are treated in the right way. 

The goal of animal rights is to stop animal exploitation done by humans. while the goal of animal welfare is to minimize, if not put to an end, any suffering and cruelty towards animals. Animal welfare is focused on making sure that the animals are cared for and are in good condition. it makes sure that proper guidelines are followed when the animals are used for food consumption, performing, creating clothes and more. These guidelines are implemented to ensure that the animals are in good and proper condition.
