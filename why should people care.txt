why should people care?

We humans depend on the coexistence of different species to have a stable and functioning ecology. We depend on animals in certain aspects of our lives such as food, clothing, companionship and others.Animals deserve the kind of respect that we humans entail. Despite of the benefits that animals give us in our lives, they should also benefit from us. We are responsible for preserving each and every live's well being because we are more than capable in doing so.
