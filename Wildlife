Wildlife

Today plenty of our wild animals have gone endangered. What was 1.3 million elephants 10 years ago is now down to only 600,000 elephants in africa. In the past 70 years 3 tiger species have gone extinct. Dozens or even hundreds of species are becoming endangered every year. All these are caused by pollution, human intervention and commercial use of wildlife. Animal body parts are gathered and traded for money, some parts are used for cosmetics, medicines and human consumption. Humans also hunt animals for fun, for earning trophies or also for food, this causes animals to suffer injuries prolonging their death, and stress.
