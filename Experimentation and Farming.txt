	<h3>Animal Experimentation</h3>
	<p>According to an article that goes into an in depth discussion about the problem with animal experimentation, there's an estimated 100 million animals that are being used in laboratory experiments world wide with over 12 Million in Europe alone. Animals such as cats, dogs, and rats among others are used in a large proportion of laboratory experiments. The views about animal experimentation are split into two opposites, one being the side of the welfarists wanting to lessen the suffering of animals being used in said experiments and the other being the side of the abolitionist who want to completely eradicate animal experimentation off the face of the planet.

Aside from the fact that factory farming affect the animals in question, it also has been known to have undesirable implications to other areas such as our environment, health, and genetic diversity among others.
